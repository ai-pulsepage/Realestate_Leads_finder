PROJECT PROPOSAL: MIAMI-DADE COUNTY MOTIVATED SELLER LEAD GENERATION PLATFORM
Prepared for: Real Estate Investment Team
Prepared by: [Your Name]
Date: [Current Date]

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I am proposing to build a comprehensive lead generation and customer relationship management platform specifically designed to identify and track distressed property sellers in Miami-Dade County, Florida. This system will aggregate public records data from county databases and court systems, enrich it with verified contact information, and provide your sales team with an AI-powered voice communication system that pre-qualifies leads before your agents spend time on calls.

The platform will focus on collecting verifiable distress signals from public records—tax delinquencies, foreclosure filings, code violations, liens, and bankruptcy cases—directly from Miami-Dade County and federal sources. Additionally, the system will integrate Google Reviews to help sellers find trusted contractors for property repairs, creating a value-add service that positions your company as a helpful partner while generating contractor referral income.

Project Duration: 16 weeks
Final Deliverable: Fully automated lead generation system with AI voice assistant, contractor referral network, and CRM covering Miami-Dade County with 10,000+ motivated seller leads

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Current approaches to finding motivated sellers have significant limitations:

Generic List Services: Platforms like Batch.com and PropStream provide broad property data without specific distress signals indicating urgent selling intent. Every investor in Miami has access to the same lists.

Stale Data: Vendor lists are typically 30-60 days behind current filings, meaning you contact sellers after multiple competitors have already reached them.

No Prioritization: All leads are treated equally with no intelligence about which sellers face the most urgent financial pressure or have multiple distress factors.

Manual Qualification Bottleneck: Your sales team must manually call hundreds of leads to find the few who are genuinely motivated, wasting 80% of their time on unproductive conversations.

Limited Value Proposition: You are just another investor making cash offers with nothing differentiating you from competitors.

What you need is a system that collects fresh distress data from authoritative Miami-Dade County sources, automatically enriches it with contact information, uses AI to pre-qualify leads, and adds value through contractor referrals—creating a competitive moat while improving conversion rates.

WHY DIVORCE AND PROBATE DATA REQUIRES THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION
Divorce filings and probate cases represent significant distress signals for motivated property sellers. However, Florida's legal framework and Miami-Dade County's technical infrastructure make direct collection of this data impractical.

Legal and Technical Barriers
Florida Statutes and Court Rules:

Florida law provides public access to court records but places restrictions on bulk collection:

Florida Statute § 61.12 addresses confidentiality in family law proceedings, particularly those involving minor children.

Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 defines confidential court records, which include portions of family law case files containing financial affidavits, child custody evaluations, and settlement agreements.

Miami-Dade County Clerk of Courts provides online case search through the Public Records portal, but this system is designed for individual lookups, not bulk data extraction.

Technical Infrastructure Limitations:

The Miami-Dade Clerk's online system (https://www2.miami-dadeclerk.com/) provides case-by-case searches but:

No public API for programmatic access exists
The web interface requires manual search parameters
Terms of service prohibit automated data collection
Rate limiting prevents systematic harvesting
Returned data includes party names and case numbers but typically not property addresses
Data Matching Complexity:

Cross-referencing divorce or probate party names with property ownership records presents challenges:

Name variations and common names producing multiple potential matches
Married names versus maiden names in divorce cases
Trust names and estate representatives in probate cases
High computational cost of fuzzy matching across large datasets
The Practical Solution: Third-Party Data Vendors
I will architect the platform to integrate with licensed third-party data vendors who maintain legal relationships with county courts and state agencies:

Vendor Integration Options:

DataTree by CoreLogic (https://www.datatree.com): Premium courthouse data with direct feeds from county recorders, offering divorce filings and probate cases with 7-14 day data freshness. API-based integration available.

ATTOM Data Solutions (https://www.attomdata.com): Comprehensive property data platform with life event triggers including divorce and probate. Real-time API access.

ListSource (https://www.listsource.com): Pre-compiled lists of divorce and probate cases matched to property records with verified contact information. Monthly CSV delivery or API access.

The system will be built with standardized import interfaces that accept data from multiple vendors in CSV, JSON, or XML formats, allowing you to start with one vendor and add or switch others without code changes. The technical infrastructure to support divorce and probate data will be in place from day one, with integration completed once vendor relationships are finalized.

Processes 100-200 leads per hour
Automatic retry logic for failed lookups
Cost tracking and budget controls to prevent overruns
4. AI Voice Communication System

An AI-powered voice assistant that pre-qualifies leads and warms them up before your sales agents get involved:

Inbound Call Handling:

Sellers who see your marketing materials call a dedicated Miami phone number. The AI assistant handles these calls:

Greets caller professionally with your company name
Confirms property address and ownership
Asks qualifying questions: property condition, timeline to sell, reason for selling, asking price expectations
Identifies motivation level and urgency
Schedules callback with human agent if qualified
Logs complete conversation transcript in CRM
Sends instant notification to team with call summary and qualification score
Outbound Call Capabilities:

The system automatically dials leads to pre-qualify them:

Makes 200-300 calls per day on autopilot
Uses natural conversational patterns
Adapts questions based on lead's distress type (tax lien asks about payment plans, foreclosure asks about timeline to auction)
Handles common objections and questions
Identifies hot leads and can immediately transfer to live agent
Leaves professional voicemails when no answer
Respects do-not-call preferences and opt-outs
Operates within TCPA compliance guidelines
Technical Implementation:

Telephony Platform: Twilio Voice API
Integration Layer: Python service managing Gemini-Twilio connection
Conversation Management: WebSocket streaming for low-latency audio
Transcript Storage: Real-time speech-to-text with sentiment analysis
Call Routing: Intelligent transfer to available human agents
Voice Assistant Training:

The AI will be trained on your specific scripts and qualification criteria:

Custom greeting and company introduction
Property-specific questions based on distress data we have
Miami market-specific questions (flood zone, hurricane damage, etc.)
Objection handling scripts
Appointment setting protocols
Transfer criteria (what qualifies as a "hot" lead)
Call Volume Capacity:

Unlimited simultaneous inbound calls (each caller gets dedicated AI assistant)
Outbound calling: 10-20 simultaneous calls (configurable)
Typical throughput: 200-300 qualification calls per day
Human agent involvement only for pre-qualified hot leads (estimated 10-15% of calls)

ELEVATOR PITCH
I'm proposing to build an automated lead generation platform that pulls distressed property seller data directly from Miami-Dade County databases—tax liens, foreclosures, code violations, liens, and bankruptcy filings—instead of relying on the same stale lists from services like Batch.com and PropStream that every other investor buys. The system will scrape public records daily, automatically skip trace for phone numbers and emails, and score leads based on how many distress signals they're showing. For divorce and probate records, Florida law makes direct scraping impractical and legally risky, so I'll build integration points for third-party data vendors like DataTree or ATTOM that have proper licensing agreements.

What you'll get:

Custom CRM - Web-based system where your team manages leads, logs activities, filters by distress type, and tracks the full sales pipeline from first contact to closed deal

Automated data collection - Daily scraping from Miami-Dade County covering all 2.7 million residents, with automatic skip tracing for contact info

Multi-signal lead scoring - Leads with multiple distress factors (tax lien + foreclosure, code violations + bankruptcy) get prioritized automatically since they're most likely to sell fast

Email and SMS campaigns - Built-in tools to send bulk outreach with templates, track opens and replies, and manage opt-outs for compliance

AI voice assistant - Handles initial contact by answering inbound calls 24/7 and making 200-300 outbound calls daily to warm up leads and pre-qualify them, so your sales agents only talk to motivated sellers who are ready to discuss offers, improving closing rates

Google Reviews contractor integration - When sellers need repairs, system searches for top-rated contractors near their property and sends recommendations, positioning you as a helpful partner while generating $50-100 referral fees per hire (potential $5,000-10,000/month additional income)

Team collaboration - Role-based permissions for admins and agents, lead assignment, activity tracking, and performance analytics showing which distress types convert best

The whole system will be live in 16 weeks—basic CRM in 4 weeks so you can start working leads immediately, automated data collection by week 8, campaign tools and contractor integration by week 12, and full AI voice capability by week 16. This means your sales team stops wasting time on cold calls to uninterested sellers and focuses only on pre-qualified, motivated prospects, while you build a referral income stream and create a competitive advantage with fresh data your competitors don't have access to.
